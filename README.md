# FpAssociativity

This is a demo application showing how floating-point operations are not
guaranteed to be associative.

This was made for [the computer trove](https://github.com/CuroSalus/the-computer-trove/blob/main/computer-engineering/floating-point-associativity.adoc)

## Instructions

* Compile and run with Visual Studio (or your preferred .NET 6+ environment).

* Supply a positive number of floating point values to run.

* Supply an offset (distance from zero to perform the demonstration).

* View result.
